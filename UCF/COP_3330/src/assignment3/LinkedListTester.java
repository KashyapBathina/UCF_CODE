Author: Kashyap Bathina--Programming Assignment 3 COP 3330
	This program is the main class of assignment 3 that reads data from a data.txt file, and adds only the positive numbers to a linked list. It 
	then iterates over the linked list again, and if sees the condition x[i] = x[i-1] * 2 + 7, removes the element of the linked list at x[i] and
	x[i-1] and then adds a node with an item element of count, which is initially set to -100 and increments each time the condition occurs.
