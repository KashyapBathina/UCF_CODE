There are some pre-written functions in C that we commonly
use. All the functions that control standard input and output
are included in the file stdio.h.
# sign indicates a preprocessing directive. This means that
sometime is done BEFORE the compiler runs. When we do a
#include, this tells the compiler to include the given file before
compilation

/*
1) Central Processing Unit: The "brains" of the computer that
actually execute all the instructions the computer runs.
2) Main Memory: All running programs and data they use
must be stored here. This is only active when the computer is
physically on.
3) External Memory: This is more permanent memory, such as
a hard-drive, floppy disk, CD, etc. In order for any programs
stored on these medium to run, they have to be transferred into
main memory.
4) Operating System: Provides an interface between the
machine and the user and allocates the computer's resources.
5) Compiler: A "translator" which converts a program written
in a high-level computer language into machine language, a set
of 0s and 1s understood by the computer.
6) Application Programs: Programs intended to be used by
end-users on a computer.



Programming Rules
    use a header comment to list author, data, purpose
    use comments on every major part
    make variable names meaningful
    use uppercase for constant, i.e. #define

Rules for identifiers i.e. variables
    must be comprissed of letters, didgits and or underscores
    a letter or _ has to be the first characters
    in some instances, casing matters when you name variables
    cannot be a key word like const, define, if, else
    when naming a function, make the name meaningful, printf()

Order of precedence
    *, /, (), and % take precedence, or go left to right if precedence equal

Assignment operators
    increment x=x+1 or x+=1 or x++
    decrement x=x-1 or x-=1 or x--
    multip x*=2
    divid x/=2
        x=x/(p+q); x/=(p+q)

// constant, data type, name, value
const int YARDS_IN_MILE = 1760;

// another way to define constant What a #define does is replace a given variable name with avalue, before a program is compiled.
