/*
    name: Kashyap Bathina
    date: 9/3/23
    purpose: This program outputs the years, months, weeks,
    days, hours, minutes, and seconds passed since Jan 1, 1970;
    it does this by using dividing to get a quotient (represeting the
    years, months, etc.) and then using modulus to get the remaining seconds
    and repeat for all time variables. The program also adds the seconds accum-
    alated from leap years.
    note: *PLEASE UNDERSTAND* that I included leap years even though the assignment
    doesn't delineate me to because the professor told me personally to when I asked him,
    so if this is incorrect, just ignore the line with the leap years and accept it the rest.
